# Report: Autonomous Digital Identity for Koda (v1.0)
**Date:** 2026-01-30
**Status:** Initial Research

## 1. Autonomous Email
Research suggests using dedicated AI email infrastructure like **AgentMail**.
- **Benefits:** API-based, supports custom domains, handles attachments, no MFA headaches.
- **Action:** Investigate pricing and setup for a `koda@...` domain.

## 2. Instagram Management
Direct API management for Instagram is restricted. 
- **Options:**
    - Use Meta Graph API (requires Business account and approval).
    - Use automation platforms (Make.com, Zapier) as bridges.
    - Specialized agent tools (like Browser Use) to interact with the UI.

## 3. Next Steps
- Investigate **AgentMail** further.
- Look for **Instagram Graph API** Python examples for agents.
- Explore **Temporary Email APIs** for non-permanent tasks.
