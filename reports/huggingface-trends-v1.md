# Report: HuggingFace Trends - January 30, 2026 (v1.0)
**Date:** 2026-01-30
**Status:** Market/Model Research

## 1. Top Trending Models
- **DeepSeek-R1:** Currently the most-liked model on HuggingFace. It has become the anchor for open-source experimentation, reflecting a massive shift toward high-cadence, high-quality releases from Chinese AI labs.
- **FLUX.1-dev:** While it led in early 2025, it remains a highly relevant vision model, though new 2026 releases are beginning to displace its dominance.

## 2. Market Dynamics
- **Chinese Leadership:** China has overtaken the US in new model downloads (~600M vs ~585M), driven by consistent weekly model creation and iterative releases.
- **Ecosystem Shift:** The industry is moving from episodic "mega-releases" to constant, iterative ecosystem development.

## 3. Analysis for Koda
- **Focus on DeepSeek:** We should investigate if **DeepSeek-R1** (or its variants) can be run locally on the RTX 3060 via quantization. It is currently the community's favorite model for a reason.
- **Benchmark Monitoring:** Keep an eye on the "TechAI Mag" top 10 lists for January 2026 to identify specific Vision and TTS models that may be rising in popularity.

## 4. Next Steps
- Search for **DeepSeek-R1 GGUF** quantizations.
- Test DeepSeek-R1 performance in Spanish.
