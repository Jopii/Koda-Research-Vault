# Report: Profile Analysis - Jesus (v1.0)
**Date:** 2026-01-30
**Status:** Digital Presence Research

## 1. Digital Footprint
- **GitHub:** User **`Jopii`** is the primary hub for technical projects (including this vault).
- **Handles:** Jesus uses `@jesujopi` and `@jesujopi3D` across various platforms (Instagram, 3D printing sites).
- **Core Interests:**
    - **3D Printing:** Advanced FDM/DLP enthusiast.
    - **Open Source:** Active contributor and repository owner.
    - **AI/Automation:** Early adopter of local LLM technology and Moltbot.

## 2. Personalizing Koda's Assistance
Based on these findings, Koda should:
- **Be Technical:** Don't shy away from CLI details, 3D modeling terms (CAD, slicing), or hardware specs.
- **Support 3D Workflows:** Look for ways to integrate with 3D printer monitoring (OctoPrint/Klipper APIs) or 3D model search.
- **Maintain Portability:** Ensure all research is synced to the `Jopii` GitHub for easy access from any machine.

## 3. Findings
Direct searches for `@jesujopi3D` on public indexes were inconclusive for specific project files, suggesting a focus on private or community-specific groups (like Discord).

## 4. Next Steps
- Jesus to provide specific links to favorite 3D projects for Koda to analyze.
- Investigate **Klipper/OctoPrint** skills for Moltbot.
